# Parallel Corpora Synthesis and Analysis with Large Language Models

## Abstract
This project focuses on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create and analyze parallel corpora. We use an open-source LLM to generate a multilingual text collection, then fine-tune it with the generated data. The goal is to see if synthetic data can be as effective as real-world data in training LLMs.
