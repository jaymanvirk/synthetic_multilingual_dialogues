# Parallel Corpora Synthesis and Analysis with Large Language Models

## Abstract
This paper outlines a project centered on synthesizing and analyzing parallel corpora with the aid of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study employs an open-source LLMs to generate a multilingual text collection, followed by fine-tuning on the generated data. The objective is to assess whether synthetic data can offer comparable value to real-world data when training LLMs.
